# HR-Attrition-Python-ML
The aim of this project is to develop the ideal classification model to predict how likely an employee is to leave the company based on the given data

The following steps were carried out to find the best model
Data Pre-profiling - This step involves identifying issues with the data before further analysis.
Data Pre-processing - This step involves cleaning up the data incosistancies identified above
Data Post-profiling - This step involves verifying the removal of all data inconsitancies
Exploratory Data Analysis - This step involves exploring the data to find correlations and other similar observations
Data Encoding - This step involves converting the data into zeros and ones for the ease of models
Data Standardiszations - This step involves the normalizing of data
Model Building - This step involves using the various models to find the right fit
Hyperparameter tuning- This step involves finding the best parameters for our model
Unseen data analysis - This step involves using the test data to check accuracy and finalizing our model
